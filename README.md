## Controls
	Arrow keys: Move
	
## Some clarifications of the code
Volume is measured in liters.
A map tile fits 3 cubic meters or 3k liters

## Tutorial
You are the tiny @ in the middle of the screen
Use the arrow keys to move
Use "rshift + arrow keys" to resize the window
Use "l" to **L**ook
Use "k" to tal**K** 

How to make a human with the command line:
- Type "mkhuman" in the command line
- To talk with the human, enter looking mode and move the cursor to the place where you put the human and press K



## Editing the tileset
I use GIMP to edit the tileset. Go to Image -> Configure grid and make it 12x12
Make sure View > Show Grid is enabled
There are tiny numbers on the right if you don't want to count from the top
The empty tiles are green, and have a number to get the low half of the position
