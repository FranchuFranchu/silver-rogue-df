# A dwarf-fortress adventure mode-inspired rogue-like Pygame Python3 game
On heavily development, especially the name

## Requirements
	python>=3.0
	autoclass
    pygame
    noise
All of them can be pip installed

## Controls
	Arrow keys: Move

## Editing the tileset
I use GIMP to edit the tileset. Go to Image -> Configure grid and make it 12x12
Make sure View > Show Grid is enabled
There are tiny numbers on the right if you don't want to count from the top
The empty tiles are green, and have a number to get the low half of the position

## Credits
[Tileset author, he hasn't provided any license](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/User:Alloy)

[I'll assume it's MIT because of the wiki politics](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/User:Alloy)

I assume this is not a "derivative work" of the tileset because you can change it if you want, correct me and i'll change the license
